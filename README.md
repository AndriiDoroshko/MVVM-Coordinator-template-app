# MVVM+Coordinator Template App Documentation

This document provides an overview of the MVVM+Coordinator template app, including its structure, components, and functionality. This template provides a foundation for building scalable and maintainable iOS applications.

## Architecture Overview

The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, combined with the Coordinator pattern for navigation and workflow management. This separation of concerns promotes code reusability, testability, and maintainability.

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the app. In this template, this includes data structures and the `NetworkService` for handling network requests.
- **View:** Responsible for displaying the user interface and capturing user interactions. This consists of `UIViewController` and `SwiftUI` `View` subclasses, e.g. `HomeViewController`, `LaunchScreen`.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It prepares data for presentation and handles user actions, e.g. `HomeViewModel`.
- **Coordinator:** Manages the navigation flow and presentation logic. Coordinators decouple view controllers from each other, improving modularity and testability, e.g. `AppCoordinator`, `HomeCoordinator`, `TabBarCoordinator`.

## Key Components

### Coordinators

- `AppCoordinator`: The main coordinator, responsible for launching the app and managing the overall navigation flow.
- `HomeCoordinator`: Handles navigation related to the home screen.
- `LaunchScreenCoordinator`: Manages the presentation of the launch screen.
- `TabBarCoordinator`: Sets up and manages the tab bar and its associated view controllers.

### View Controllers and SwiftUI Views

- `HomeViewController`: Displays the home screen content.
- `LaunchScreen`: The SwiftUI view for the launch screen.
- `TabBarController`: The main tab bar controller of the app.

### ViewModels

- `HomeViewModel`: Provides data and logic for the `HomeViewController`.

### Services

- `NetworkService`: Handles network requests and data fetching. Implements the `NetworkServiceProtocol`.

### Networking

- `NetworkURLs`: Contains network URLs used by the NetworkService.
- `NetworkError`: Defines possible network errors.

## Inputs and Outputs

The app's primary input is user interaction within the various screens. The outputs include:

- Display of data fetched from the network.
- Navigation between screens based on user actions and application state.
- Presentation of error messages to the user in case of network or data issues.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.
4. Navigate through the app using the tab bar.

## Additional Notes

- The template uses a placeholder network service, which can be replaced with a real implementation.
- Error handling is implemented using the `NetworkError` enum.
- The launch screen is implemented using SwiftUI.
